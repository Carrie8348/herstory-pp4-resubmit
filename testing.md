## Validations
#### HTML
- The W3C Markup Validator service was used to validate the HTML.
- Most of HTML pages are tested and passed with no errors.
- The "mobile_top_header" html file in "templates - includes" folder, is showing error because there is no <ol> or <ul> starting the file. But if I added it, the whole mobile top nav get ruied. So I keep it this way.


#### CSS
- The W3C Markup Validator service was used to validate the CSS.
- All CSS files are tested and passed with no errors.

#### Python
- The PEP8 Python validator service was used to validate the python files.
- In the testing, the main errors are because lines are too long. I tried to make them shorter, but it passed the test but did not function right on the site anymore. Therefore I put #noqa at the end of the lines.

#### JavaScript
- I used https://jshint.com/ to test the JavaScript. The error appears, claims undefined variable "Stripe," but since this code was copied from Boutique Ado, and it is too vital for the site to work, I ignored it for the moment.

## Lighthouse Validation
The site has been tested with Lighthouse. Performance could be further improved by analyzing the file types of images. Also since I use a free subscription for the Heroku app it starts really slowly which can affect the performance score.
![Lighthouse-validator](/documentations/pics/lighthouse.png)

## Browser Validation
The site was tested on different browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

## User testing
I have several family and friends view and tried the site, and they like the look of it and think it functions well and smoothly.
