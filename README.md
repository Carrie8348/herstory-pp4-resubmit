## Introduction

Women are as complicated as men. 

For many, many centuries, we have tried to tell our stories. Yet, in history, we did not have many audiences. Even lots of women themselves would not believe we do have stories to tell. 

But until recent years, through a series of feminist movements, for example, #metoo, women have started to say no to things they don't want to do, and we use all different ways to memorize our journeys, raise our voices, and ensure our stories are heard.

Herstory is a website that introduces meaningful documentaries about women, hoping to inspire audiences, and brings many thoughts, stories, and ideas to them. 

We want to build an excellent community for documentary lovers and those interested in feminist history.

## SEO Implementation

I have used the following meta to implement my SEO words:
 ```sh
<meta name="description" content="HerStory, documentaries about women">
```
 ```sh
 <meta name="keywords" content="women, woman, documentary, feminist, female">
```

## Social Links

#### Facebook
It is the most common platform to interact with site users to start a campaign. Right now, no such Facebook page is created, but it is an idea for future events coming, so this could be useful.

#### Instagram
Another great platform is Instagram. Facebook is for the first generation of internet users, and Instagram targets younger generations. So far, there is an Instagram icon linking to my personal IG account. In the future, hopefully, we will create an account and showcase our documentary collections to millions of potential customers out there.


#### Linked-In
There is a link to my linked-in account URL for business growth potential. It is an authentic platform for people interested in this site or potential suppliers to build up open and honest business possibilities. 


## Bugs

- Watchlist Error: There was no showing on this page after I added the movie to the list. But it shows in the database. 
- Solution: After many, many times checking my models and view, I found this minor typo issue that calls "movie" "Movie," which caused the problem. Therefore it was solved.

<hr>

- Heroku App  Error:  I have deployed the project on the Heroku app with no problem, but when I click "open app" on Heroku, it shows the " --tail" error.

- Solution: Tutor Christine Kelley helped me with this one as I am still unfamiliar with spotting issues with Heroku logs. She discovered that the "all auth" wasn't appropriately added to the "Requirement.txt" file. Therefore I use the command "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt" to solve it. It works!

<hr>

- Another was the Heroku displaying issue: When I could successfully open the app from the Heroku site, the logo and header pic was not showing correctly on the page, the links were turning blue, and the display of movies was wrong.

- Solution: Since the previously mentioned "all auth" error caused the deploying issue, I added the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" back in the config vars in the Heroku settings. And the "Debug=True" by the time tutor Christine Kelley suggested I change it to "False" and delete the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC."  Then it works!

## Special Thanks
This is the second time I have worked on PP4. I certainly know a lot more after the studies and the work on project 5.  

I must thank all the tutors, Ger Tobin, Christine Kelley, and Kevin Loughrey. Even this time around, I knew more, but I still got caught up in things I was not capable of. Your help and advice are very much appreciated. And the encouragements, I wish we'd cheered with wine haha.

And to the assessment result last time. It was very fair. I didn't do enough CRUD and failed. It pushed me to face it and work harder. And I am much more confident now.
